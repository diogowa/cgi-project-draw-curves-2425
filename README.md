# WebGL Curve Visualisation

This project was developed as part of my university course in Computer Graphics and Interfaces. The main objective was to create a **WebGL application** capable of generating and visualising cubic B-spline curves in real time using a combination of **JavaScript** and **GLSL shaders**.


## Project objective

The application enables users to create and visualise cubic B-spline, Catmull-Rom and Bézier curves. Each curve is visualised using a GLSL program capable of producing the intermediate points of a given curve. This program receives an integer index as an attribute, which marks the position of the vertex on the curve.
